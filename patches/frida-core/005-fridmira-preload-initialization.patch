Subject: [PATCH 006/006] GitButler Workspace Commit

This is a merge commit the virtual branches in your workspace.

Due to GitButler managing multiple virtual branches, you cannot switch back and
forth between git branches and virtual branches easily.

If you switch to another branch, GitButler will need to be reinitialized.
If you commit on this branch, GitButler will throw it away.

Here are the branches that are currently applied:
 - i-branch-1 (refs/gitbutler/i-branch-1)
   branch head: 41cc6879e5c5bb1ecf2429d9fba0dc95874b4213
